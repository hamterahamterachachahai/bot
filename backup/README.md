# Discord Bot Backup

This backup was created on July 6, 2025, before implementing additional refinements.

## Files Included:
- `bot.py` - Main bot file with hybrid commands and user restrictions
- `cogs/` - All 8 cog modules (admin, moderation, general, fun, games, info, misc, utility)
- `.env` - Environment configuration with bot token and allowed user IDs
- `.env.example` - Example environment configuration
- `pyproject.toml` - Python project dependencies
- `replit.md` - Project documentation and architecture

## Current State:
- Bot supports both slash commands (/) and prefix commands (!)
- Only authorized users (1371770747692777553, 1318613193215705211, 1151217188951298138, 980130432882454578) can use commands
- Unauthorized users are silently ignored
- 66 commands across 8 cogs
- All configuration managed through .env file

## To Restore:
1. Copy files from backup/ to root directory
2. Restart the bot workflow
3. Ensure .env file has correct bot token

This backup preserves the fully working state before any further refinements.
